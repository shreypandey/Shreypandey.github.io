Hello! I'm currently a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/) at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) in Bangalore, working on Copilot Agents and [Programming with Representations (PwR)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/pwr/) to transform software development with generative AI. With a background in Computer Science and Engineering, my career includes impactful roles in software engineering and data science at [Myntra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myntra), where I led the optimization of machine learning systems for enhanced product recommendations and search.

Beyond my technical endeavors, I am deeply passionate about history and geography, exploring the interplay between technology and diverse cultures.
